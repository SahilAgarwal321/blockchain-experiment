# Experiments with Blockchain.
-------------------------------

Suprisingly, I've learnt a lot about python while working on this.
This has become a lesson on how python's classes work. What's beneath the hood.

I will do a write-up on this one day. A step by step guide on how this was made. I think it will be very useful for someone looking to understand python's classes. Or get a refresher I guess.

Alas, that day is not today.
